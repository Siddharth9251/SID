							<h2>D3 (IPL Analysis)</h2>
							<p>D3 (Data-Driven Documents) is a powerful JavaScript library used for creating interactive and dynamic data visualizations on the web. It provides a range of tools and functions for manipulating data and generating various types of charts, including bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and geographic maps. D3 allows users to bind data to HTML, SVG, and CSS elements and apply data-driven transformations to those elements, creating dynamic visualizations that change based on the data being visualized. D3 is a popular choice for creating data visualizations because it is flexible, customizable, and can be integrated with other JavaScript libraries and frameworks for more complex web applications.

								By using a variety of visualizations, the D3 project was able to provide a comprehensive analysis of IPL's various teams performance, highlighting key insights and trends that helped the company make data-driven decisions about its business strategies.</p>

							<h2>Python Analysis</h2>
							<p>Pandas is a Python library for data analysis and manipulation, which provides user-friendly data structures and tools for working with structured data, including time-series data. It also offers support for reading and writing data in various formats, such as CSV, Excel, and SQL databases. With pandas, you can easily clean, transform, and aggregate data, handle missing data, and perform statistical analysis.

								Matplotlib, on the other hand, is a popular Python library for creating static visualizations. It offers a wide range of tools and functions for creating different types of charts and plots, such as line charts, scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, and more. Matplotlib is highly customizable, and you can adjust every aspect of your visualizations, from the axis labels and tick marks to the colors and styles of the lines or bars. It also supports multiple output formats, including PNG, PDF, and SVG, and can be integrated with other libraries like NumPy and pandas for data analysis and manipulation.</p>

							<h3>Context of Data</h3>
							<p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players each on a cricket field, at the centre of which is a rectangular 20-metre (22-yard) pitch with a target at each end called the wicket (a set of three wooden stumps upon which two bails sit). Each phase of play is called an innings, during which one team bats, attempting to score as many runs as possible, whilst their opponents bowl and field, attempting to minimise the number of runs scored. When each innings ends, the teams usually swap roles for the next innings (i.e. the team that previously batted will bowl/field, and vice versa). The teams each bat for one or two innings, depending on the type of match. The winning team is the one that scores the most runs, including any extras gained (except when the result is not a win/loss result). </p>
